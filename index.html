				Although our society has changed a great deal from the past, racism is still a very real issue in our lives 
				that many people face. Everyone deserves to be treated equally. No one should be judged by the colour of their 
				skin or how they look. In my website, I will be going over some tips/advice we can use to educate ourselves  
				and also protect ourselves against racism.
